## 📌 Project Overview

This internship involved working on two real-world data science problems with a focus on machine learning and predictive modeling:

### 1. 🔧 Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing

**Goal:** Predict when machinery is likely to fail to avoid unplanned downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.

**Approach:**
- Utilized sensor data such as vibration and temperature readings.
- Implemented time-series forecasting and classification models.
- Applied models including:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)

### 2. 💳 Credit Risk Modeling

**Goal:** Predict the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan.

**Approach:**
- Worked with financial and credit history datasets.
- Performed extensive feature engineering, including:
  - Credit utilization rate
  - Debt-to-income ratio
  - Payment history trends
- Built and evaluated predictive models using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)
  - Scorecard modeling techniques

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, LightGBM  
- imbalanced-learn (for class balancing)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
